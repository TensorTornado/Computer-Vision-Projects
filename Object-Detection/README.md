# Object Detection Project

This project demonstrates the detection of multiple objects in an image or video using advanced machine learning models.

## Overview

- **Model:** YOLO (You Only Look Once) / SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)
- **Dataset:** COCO / Pascal VOC
- **Tools:** Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Keras
- **Goal:** To accurately detect objects and their locations in real-time.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TensorTornado/Computer-Vision-Projects.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Download a pre-trained model or train one from scratch using the provided scripts.
Run object detection on an image or video stream.

Results
The model can detect X objects with Y% accuracy in real-time.

Future Work
Improve object detection accuracy using advanced models like EfficientDet.
Apply this model to video streams for real-time detection.
