# Computer Vision Projects
This repository contains a collection of computer vision projects developed using popular libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Streamlit. Each project folder is dedicated to a specific task in computer vision, covering topics such as image classification, object detection, motion detection, and face recognition.
## Projects Overview
- **[Image Classification](./Image-Classification/README.md)**:  
  Classifies images into different categories using machine learning models. This project covers model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- **[Object Detection](./Object-Detection/README.md)**:  
  Detects objects in images or video streams and highlights their locations using bounding boxes. This project demonstrates state-of-the-art object detection methods.

- **[Motion Detection](./Motion-Detection/README.md)**:  
  Identifies and tracks motion in video feeds. This project applies video processing techniques to detect and monitor movement in real-time.

- **[Face Recognition](./Face-Recognition/README.md)**:  
  Recognizes and identifies faces using deep learning models. The project includes training models to detect and match faces from images or video feeds.
## Structure
Each project folder contains:
- **Code**: Source code for implementing the respective computer vision task.
- **Datasets**: Links or references to datasets used for training and testing.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of the approach, methodology, and results.
Feel free to explore the projects and modify them to suit your needs. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
