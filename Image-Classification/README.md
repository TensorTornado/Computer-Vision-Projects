# Image Classification Project
This project focuses on classifying images into predefined categories using machine learning and deep learning models. 
## Overview
- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- **Dataset:** [Insert dataset name and source, e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet, custom dataset]
- **Tools:** Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV
- **Goal:** To classify images based on their content, such as animals, objects, or scenes.
