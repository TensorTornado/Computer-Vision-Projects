# Motion Detection Project
This project focuses on detecting motion in video feeds, which can be useful for surveillance and anomaly detection.
## Overview
- **Approach:** Frame subtraction / Background subtraction
- **Tools:** Python, OpenCV
- **Goal:** To detect and track motion in video feeds.
## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Computer-Vision-Projects.git
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the motion detection script on a video file or live camera feed.
Results
The algorithm successfully detects and highlights motion in real-time.

Future Work
Implement object tracking along with motion detection.
Use deep learning to enhance motion detection performance.
